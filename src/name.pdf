About Neutreeno
Imagine a future where companies can slash emissions not just by a little, but significantly
across vast and complex supply chains. Neutreeno, a pioneering deep tech spinout from the
University of Cambridge’s Engineering Department, is turning this vision into a reality.
Our revolutionary digital platform precisely tracks process flows, equipping businesses with
scientific, data-driven insights needed to optimise emission reduction interventions across
thousands of suppliers.
Neutreeno is not just about cutting-edge tech; it’s about pioneering a new low-carbon era with a
brain trust of leading sustainability scientists from the IPCC, IEA, the Cambridge Engineering
Department and other renowned Universities. Together, our research underpins a
transformative technology already adopted by some of the world’s largest companies.
Our impact is resonating globally. We just raised a US-led $5m seed round from leading global
investors in circularity, sustainability, and corporates as featured in ESGPost, YahooFinance,
BusinessWeekly.
